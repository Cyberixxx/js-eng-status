* *Questions*

	* **Q:** What's the difference between GitHub and Bitbucket ?
		* **A:** The basic difference is in different Revision Control System - Github uses only the Git, Bitbucket uses both Git and Mercurial.
		* Other differencies are in type of accounts and thus allowed types of repositories - Github doesn`t allow private repositories on the free plans, but this is allowed by Bitbucket
		* Despite of advantages of private repositories Bitbucket has less users than Github (Bitbucket > 1 000 000 of users, Github > 4 000 000 of users).
		* Github is used by modern and extremely growing projects, such as Linux Kernel, Neo4J and others.
		* Also they have different pricing model which is based on private repositories / quantity of contributors
	* **Q:** Why we need to create two types of reports each day ?
		* **A:** Because two types of reports helps us to divide our future tasks with setted priority from already finished tasks with time for their execution. Thus we can plan our tasks, building task list using priority and forecast estimated time for task execution.
